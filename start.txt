Test text file that I write to disk. Say whaaa?
I am going to input a lot of freaken text so that I can check this comparing tool that I have.
The tool is somekind of a light visual studio program called "Code".


This is the contents of my ~/.gitconfig file:
[user]
	name = mikser.-----
	email = mikser.----@----.--
[core]
	editor = code -multiInst -nosession

here are the commands that I've input to make these:
>git config --global user.name "..."
>git config --global user.email "...@.."
>git config --global core.editor "code -multiInst -nosession"

The last one sets default text editor from "vi" to Visual Studio Code so that the following command:
>git config --global -e
opens global configuration file (~/.gitconfig) in Visual Studio Code to edit it instead of "vi" editor
